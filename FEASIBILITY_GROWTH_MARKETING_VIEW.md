# Meshy Makers — Feasibility & Growth Marketing View

Below is a practical, growth‑marketing view of feasibility and execution for the Meshy Makers program.

---

## 1) First 2–3 Creator Groups to Recruit

### 1.1 YouTube 3D Workflow Educators (10k–150k subs)
**Why they apply:** Meshy saves production time and gives repeatable tutorial formats (prompt → mesh → polish → engine). The revenue share + spotlight is meaningful at this tier, and they’re typically open to tooling partnerships.  
**Growth impact:** High conversion potential because audiences are builders with purchase intent. Strong SEO/evergreen content value for “how‑to” queries.

### 1.2 Short‑Form 3D Creators (TikTok / YouTube Shorts / Reels)
**Why they apply:** Meshy creates fast, visually impressive transformations that short‑form thrives on. They can produce 4 pieces/month without large production overhead.  
**Growth impact:** High reach and awareness at low cost. Even if conversions are lower, they increase top‑funnel volume and brand recall.

### 1.3 Indie Game Dev Creators (YouTube + Discord, 5k–50k subs)
**Why they apply:** Meshy accelerates asset creation for games and dev logs. They can showcase real production use, not just tutorials.  
**Growth impact:** Strong downstream conversion because viewers are actively building and likely to pay for tools that speed shipping.

## 2) Creator Marketplace Strategy

### 2.1 Designing incentives without wasting budget
- Default to **credits + revenue share**.
- Reserve **paid collabs** for proven performers (conversion or quality milestones).
- Tie higher benefits to **measurable output** (publish cadence + tracking).

### 2.2 Accountability for delivery + quality
- Require a **first post in 14 days**.
- Monthly review against cadence + quality checklist.
- Tier down or pause after 60 days inactive.

## 3) Application Growth Plan + Metrics

### 3.1 How to get creators to apply (channels + messaging)
- **Owned channels:** homepage banner, product UI banner, email to active users → “Turn your builds into content + earn.”
- **Community:** Discord + Reddit + creator forums → “Get credits + spotlight for sharing workflows.”
- **Social proof:** 2–3 pilot creators featured in first week → “Here’s what Makers are building.”

**Why it works:** You target creators already using or adjacent to Meshy, reduce friction with a clear benefit stack, and show proof fast.

### 3.2 Top 3 success metrics
1. **Activation rate** (approved creators who publish within 14 days)  
   Measures whether incentives and onboarding actually convert into output.
2. **Content cadence adherence** (avg. pieces per creator per month)  
   Ensures the program is producing consistent supply, not just signups.
3. **Paid conversion from creator traffic** (signups → paid)  
   Outcome metric that proves real growth impact, not just impressions.
